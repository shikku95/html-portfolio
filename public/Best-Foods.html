    <h3>1.Chicken Dum Biriyani</h3>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved <br>for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It <br> has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati <br> rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>

    <h3>2.Parotta with Chicken/beef curry</h3>
    <p>Parotta is a traditional Southern Indian flatbread, usually sold as street food. It is <br>also popular in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. It is madewith oil or ghee, water, refined <br>wheat flour known as maida (unlike parathas, which are made with regular wheat), <br>and occasionally eggs.</p>

    <h3>3.Chicken Mandhi</h3>
    <p>The name kuzhimanthi is a portmanteau of mandi and kuzhy, the Malayalam word for <br>the deep pit in which this dish has to be cooked. Rice in a biryani is often dum, that is,<br> tightly covered and cooked with steam, and cooked with oil.</p>
